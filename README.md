# RogueDex: A really dumb project
It's a school project. But absurd.
4 parts:
- picoNet: low-level networking stack written from the ground up **(COMPLETE)**
- battledex-engine: a game engine written from the ground up to be easily ruleset-expandable
- atlas-engine: a powerful graphics engine written in panda3d and moderngl for massive 3D open worlds powered by python
- rotomdex: an interface with battledex-engine implementing the pokemon ruleset
