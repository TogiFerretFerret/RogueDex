a joke that became less joke
bsaically i decided i wanted to make a bytecode-based language
so then like.. i decided it would be cool if the battles in my cs9 project were controlled by user algorithms
and i was like... what if the algorithm was in a bytecode-based language!!!! whoa!!!
so then i made another (read: first non-vibe-coded {i am not cool enough to not vibe code occasionally}) bytecode based language
and this is it
so yeah
low quality code
sorry about that
its not competitive programming quality ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
