battledex_engine/interfaces.py

Defines the abstract base classes (ABCs) that form the contract between
the battle engine and a specific ruleset implementation (like rotomdex).

These interfaces ensure that the engine can remain completely agnostic
of any specific game's rules, allowing for maximum modularity.
